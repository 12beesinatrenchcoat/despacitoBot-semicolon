# despacitoBot- 

a bad discord bot that replies to people with despacito videos whenever they say "this is so sad play despacito". a sort of personal project of my own to slowly learn how discord bot-making works.

## the archival
i no longer have the free time to develop this bot. on top of that, i simply... don't want to develop this bot. for now, this bot is done for. i'll make a proper bot in the future.
and also from now on this is under the unlicense.

*(the [master branch](https://github.com/AndyThePie/despacitoBot-semicolon) is stable and live, the [dev branch](https://github.com/AndyThePie/despacitoBot-semicolon/tree/dev) is for testing and all the sort.)*


## dependencies

this bot currently runs on node.js v10.16.3 and uses:

- [discord.js v11.5.1](https://discord.js.org/)
- [request 2.81.0](https://github.com/request/request)



## can i get the bot in my own discord server?

no. at least, probably not. i have no idea how much the heroku dyno can handle, and so for now, i'm limiting it to my own server and the servers of my friends.



## can i contribute too?

if you want to. (my knowledge is very limited...) 



### this readme annoys me, why don't you capitalize anything?

i like lowercase letters.
