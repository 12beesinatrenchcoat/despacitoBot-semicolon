# despacitoBot- 

a bad discord bot that replies to people with despacito videos whenever they say "this is so sad play despacito". a sort of personal project of my own to slowly learn how discord bot-making works.

*this is the dev branch. you can find the master branch [here](https://github.com/AndyThePie/despacitoBot-semicolon/).*

*(this dev branch is where all the larger future updates will be before they get merged into the master branch.)*

## dependencies

this bot currently runs on node.js v10.16.3 and uses:

- [discord.js v11.5.1](https://discord.js.org/)
- [request 2.81.0](https://github.com/request/request)



## can i get the bot in my own discord server?

no. at least, probably not. i have no idea how much the heroku dyno can handle, and so for now, i'm limiting it to my own server and the servers of my friends.



## can i contribute too?

if you want to. (my knowledge is very limited...) 



### this readme annoys me, why don't you capitalize anything?

i like lowercase letters.
